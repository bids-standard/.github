## Code of Conduct {#coc}
### Our Pledge {#our-pledge}

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards {#our-standards}

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. For example, use of overtly obscene language.

### Our Responsibilities {#our-responsibilities}

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

### Scope {#scope}

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in other spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Members of the BIDS community interact with each other in a variety of different capacities and contexts. For example:

- Interactions on BIDS online spaces:
  - BIDS GitHub repository issues/pull requests (on BIDS-related repositories).
  - BIDS mailing list.
  - BIDS-related channels on the Brainhack mattermost.
  - When an individual is representing the project/community in other forums (e.g., in a conference talk, seminar, or similar).

- BIDS events:
  - BIDS development meetings
  - Hackathon events focused on BIDS

In addition, members of the BIDS community may represent the community when using an official BIDS e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.


### Community Member Procedure For Reporting Code of Conduct Incidents {#community-member-procedure-for-reporting-code-of-conduct-incidents}

If you believe someone is in physical danger, including from themselves, the most important thing is to ensure that person gets help. Please contact the appropriate crisis number, non-emergency number, or police number.

If you believe someone has violated the BIDS Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it. If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by the BIDS Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We are fine with receiving reports where we decide to take no action for the sake of creating a safer space.

If you find that you need to make a report and you cannot find the appropriate Code of Conduct reporting contact, you may report to the [BIDS maintainers email](mailto:bids.maintenance+coc@gmail.com), so that they will handle your report. If this happens, please also mention that you could not find specific reporting information so that we can improve it.

#### General BIDS reporting procedure {#general-bids-reporting-procedure}

The best way to contact the BIDS Code of Conduct working group is by email at [bids.maintenance+coc@gmail.com](mailto:bids.maintenance+coc@gmail.com). The maintainers monitoring this alias are listed at [https://bids.neuroimaging.io/governance\#bids-maintainers-group](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/governance#bids-maintainers-group).

In the event of a conflict of interest, you may contact any BIDS Maintainer or BIDS Steering Group Member directly at their contact information available here. Response times may be longer if you contact someone directly, and the person will communicate with the reporter to establish a response group without a conflict of interest.

If needed (e.g., if there are conflicts of interest with current maintainers / steering group members), you can also contact some previous members of the BIDS steering group to make a report:

* Ariel Rokem, [arokem@uw.edu](mailto:arokem@uw.edu)
* XXX

#### Report data {#report-data}

When you make a report via email or phone, please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Date and time of the incident
* Location of incident (can be online)
* Whether the incident is ongoing
* Description of the incident
* Identifying information of the reported person: name, physical appearance, height, clothing, voice accent, identifying badge information such as company name, ribbons, or badge number
* Additional circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in or witnesses to the incident and their contact information or description

Please provide as much information as possible.

#### Confidentiality {#confidentiality}

All reports will be kept confidential. When we discuss incidents with people who are reported, we will anonymize details as much as we can to protect the reporter’s privacy.

However, some incidents happen in one-on-one interactions, and even if the details are anonymized, the reported person may be able to guess who made the report. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please note those in your report. We still encourage you to report, so that we can support you while keeping our community members safe. In some cases, we can compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action on that pattern.

In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

#### Report Handling Procedure {#report-handling-procedure}

When you make a report to an incident responder, they will gather information about the incident according to the BIDS Procedure For Incident Response.

After an incident responder takes the report, they will immediately establish a 3 person Code of Conduct Response Group with at least  1 (past or present) BIDS steering group members and 1 BIDS maintainer, unless there is a conflict of interest, in which case any non-interested parties will be contacted.

If the incident is ongoing and needs to be immediately addressed, any of the members of the 3-person CoC response group may take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone involved. If the situation requires it, this may take the form of a referral to an appropriate non-BIDS entity, including local law enforcement. The BIDS community is not equipped to handle emergency situations.

If the incident is less urgent, the report will be discussed by the Code of Conduct Working Group, which will meet to determine an appropriate response. Examples of possible incident responses are outlined in the BIDS Procedure For Incident Response.

Procedures for in-person gatherings at e.g., conferences and workshops are likely handled by the local organizing committee to discuss all incidents and determine any necessary follow-up actions. Incidents can additionally fall within the scope of the BIDS CoC (e.g., if an incident occurs while a member of the community is speaking as a representative of BIDS).

#### Following up with reporters {#following-up-with-reporters}

Within one week of an incident report, a member of the Code of Conduct Working Group, or one of the lead responders, will follow up with the person who made the report and provided their contact information. The follow up may include:

* An acknowledgment that the Code of Conduct responders discussed the situation
* Whether or not the report was determined to be a violation of the Code of Conduct
* What actions (if any) were taken to address the reported behavior

In some cases, the lead responders may need to ask additional questions about the incident in order to identify the reported person.

#### Conflict of Interest  {#conflict-of-interest}

If an incident responder has a conflict of interest for a report, they will recuse themselves from the discussion and handling of the incident. The incident documentation will not be available to them, and they will excuse themselves from any conversations involving handling the incident.

Examples of conflicts of interest include:

* The reporter or reported person is your manager.
* You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. It's fine to participate if they are an acquaintance.
* The reporter or reported person is your metamour. (This is a term used in the poly community; the short definition is [here](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metamour), and a longer description is [here](https://solopoly.net/2012/09/29/whats-a-metamour-on-my-terms/)).
* The reporter or reported person is your family member.
* The reporter or reported person is someone with whom you have a business relationship.
* The reporter or reported person works in the same institution as you.
* The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who works on the same project as you (e.g., in multi-institutional collaborations).

Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. Other work group members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest. Anyone who has a conflict of interest will remove themselves from the discussion of the incident, and recuse themselves from voting on a response to the report.

Should more than two of the BIDS lead incident responders need to recuse themselves, another BIDS steering committee member or maintainer will step in as a temporary lead incident responder.

### Code of Conduct Enforcement Procedure {#code-of-conduct-enforcement-procedure}

This document summarizes the procedures the BIDS Code of Conduct response group uses to enforce the Code of Conduct.

#### Summary of processes {#summary-of-processes}

When the BIDS maintainers receive a report of a possible Code of Conduct violation, it will:

* Acknowledge the receipt of the report.
* Evaluate conflicts of interest.
* Establish a **3 person BIDS code of conduct response group** with at least 1 (past or present) BIDS steering group member and 1 BIDS maintainer without a conflict of interest to handle the report.

The working group will then:

* Call a meeting of work group members.
* Evaluate the reported incident.
* Propose a behavioral modification plan.
* Propose consequences for the reported behavior.
* Vote on behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person.
* Contact online community administrators/moderators to approve the behavioral modification plan and consequences.
* Follow up with the reported person.
* Decide further responses.
* Follow up with the reporter.
* Send a summary to the BIDS maintainers and steering group.

#### Acknowledge the report {#acknowledge-the-report}

Reporters should receive an emailed acknowledgment of the receipt of their report within 48 hours.

### Evaluating a report {#evaluating-a-report}

#### Jurisdiction {#jurisdiction}

* *Is this a Code of Conduct violation?* Is this behavior on our list of inappropriate behavior? Is it borderline inappropriate behavior? Does it violate our community norms?
* *Did this occur in the scope of our Code of Conduct?* If the incident occurred outside the community, but a community member's mental health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken, the incident may be in scope. Private conversations in community spaces are also in scope.

#### Impact {#impact}

* *Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public space?* Incidents that all community members can see will have more negative impact.
* *Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our community?* Is the reporter a person from a marginalized group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person's behavior? Are members of the marginalized group likely to disengage with the community if no action was taken on this report?
* *Does this incident involve a community leader?* Community members often look up to community leaders to set the standard of acceptable behavior.

#### Risk {#risk}

* *Does this incident include sexual harassment?*
* *Does this pose a safety risk?* Does the behavior put a person's physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely negatively impact someone's mental health?
* *Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated?* Does the reported person understand why their behavior was inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behavior from past reports?

Reports which involve higher risk or higher impact may face more severe consequences than reports which involve lower risk or lower impact

### Propose a behavioral modification plan {#propose-a-behavioral-modification-plan}

The work group will determine a concrete behavioral modification plan that ensures the inappropriate behavior is not repeated. The work group will also discuss what actions may need to be taken if the reported person does not agree to the behavioral modification plan.

What follows are examples of possible behavioral modification plans for incidents that occur in online spaces under the scope of this Code of Conduct. This behavioral modification list is not inclusive, and the BIDS Code of Conduct work group reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary.

* Requiring that the reported person not use specific language
* Requiring that the reported person not join in on specific types of discussions
* Requiring that the reported person not send private messages to a community member
* Requiring that the reported person not join specific communication channels
* Removing the reported person from administrator or moderator rights to community infrastructure
* Removing a volunteer from their duties and responsibilities
* Removing a person from leadership of relevant organizations
* Removing a person from membership of relevant organizations

### Propose consequences {#propose-consequences}

What follows are examples of possible consequences to an incident report. This consequences list is not inclusive, and the BIDS Conduct work group reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary.

Possible private responses to an incident include:

* Nothing, if the behavior was determined to not be a Code of Conduct violation
* A verbal or emailed warning
* A final warning
* Temporarily removing the reported person from the online community
* Permanently removing the reported person from the online community
* Publishing an account of the incident

### Work group vote {#work-group-vote}

Decisions on the behavioral modification plans and consequences will be determined by a majority vote of the BIDS Code of Conduct work group.

### Administrators/moderators approval {#administrators/moderators-approval}

Once the work group has approved the behavioral modification plans and consequences, they will communicate the recommended response to the BIDS maintainers. The work group should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report.

The BIDS maintainers are required to respond back with whether they accept the recommended response to the report. If they disagree with the recommended response, they should provide a detailed response or additional context as to why they disagree. BIDS maintainers are encouraged to respond within a week.

In cases where the BIDS maintainers disagree on the suggested resolution for a report, the BIDS Code of Conduct work group may choose to notify the BIDS steering group.

### Follow up with the reported person {#follow-up-with-the-reported-person}

The BIDS Code of Conduct work group will work with online community administrators/moderators to draft a response to the reported person. The email should contain:

* A description of the person's behavior in neutral language
* The negative impact of that behavior
* A concrete behavioral modification plan
* Any consequences of their behavior

The work group should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information from the report. The reported person should be discouraged from contacting the reporter to discuss the report. If they wish to apologize to the reporter, the work group can accept the apology on behalf of the reporter.

### Decide further responses {#decide-further-responses}

If the reported person provides additional context, the BIDS Code of Conduct work group may need to re-evaluate the behavioral modification plan and consequences.

### Follow up with the reporter {#follow-up-with-the-reporter}

A person who makes a report should receive a follow-up email stating what action was taken in response to the report. If the work group decided no response was needed, they should provide an email explaining why it was not a Code of Conduct violation. Reports that are not made in good faith may receive no response.

The follow-up email should be sent no later than one week after the receipt of the report. If deliberation or follow-up with the reported person takes longer than one week, the work group should send a status email to the reporter.

### Documentation and Privacy policies {#documentation-and-privacy-policies}

Depending on how the Code of Conduct response group is set up, there may be different places where information about the Code of Conduct reports may be accessible:

* Personal email of Code of Conduct committee members
* Archives of committee mailing lists
* Logs from committee online chats
* Shared online documents, such as Google Docs or Next Cloud documents

In all cases, documents and notes should only be available to committee members who do not have a conflict of interest for the report. This requires communities to choose documentation tools that will meet their privacy needs.

### Committee online discussion {#committee-online-discussion}

A Code of Conduct committee may have an online, real-time discussion forum, such as Slack, or Mattermost. If the online chat platform allows, it is recommended to set the committee channel to have past history not be available to new committee members who join the channel, or to create ad-hoc channels to discuss specific reports.

When a report comes in and a discussion needs to happen in an online space, care needs to be taken to avoid conflicts of interest. In the committee chat channel, state 'We have a report that involves \[REPORTED PERSON\]'. Do not say who was the reporter or who were witnesses if the report was sent to an individual committee member. Ask which committee members do not have a conflict of interest. Add those committee members to a group discussion, separate from the committee channel. If a committee member does not respond, do not add them to the new group discussion. If a committee member finds they have a conflict of interest because of who reported the incident or who witnessed it, they should recuse themselves from the discussion.

Committee members should not use bots or IRC bouncers to log the group discussions. All documentation of discussions and decisions should be put in online, shared documentation.

If no online real-time discussion forum is used, committee members without a conflict of interest will discuss the case on a separate email thread. If no committee member has a conflict of interest, and the committee email is an alias, the committee may reply to the alias to discuss the issues.

### Shared documentation {#shared-documentation}

The Code of Conduct committee should keep two types of shared documents:

* A spreadsheet with the status of open and closed cases
* A separate document for each report

#### Status Spreadsheet {#status-spreadsheet}

The spreadsheet with status of open and closed cases should have the following format:

| Safety risk? | Risk of repeating? | Status | Code Name | Date & Time | Actions needed | Resolution |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Yes | Yes | Ongoing | home shelf | 07/07 8:30am and 07/08 12:30pm | Team on the lookout for reported person | Temporary ban for the remainder of the event, reevaluate attendance for next year |
| No | Maybe | Resolved | stunned bulb | 07/07 8:00pm | \- | Verbal warning |

Keep resolutions and notes vague enough that enforcement team members with a conflict of interest don't know the details of the incident. Use gender-neutral language when describing the reported person in the spreadsheet.

#### Report Documentation {#report-documentation}

Each report should be assigned a code name, using an online random phrase generator. The code name should be used in the document's title. Only committee members without a conflict of interest should have access to the report documentation.

Report documents should include:

* A summary of a verbal report, or the text of an emailed report. Use neutral, non-judgmental words to describe the behavior. Where possible, separate out the behavior of the reported person and the impact on the reporter.
* A summary of committee discussions, including whether the report is in scope
* Proposed behavioral modification plan
* Proposed consequences for the reported behavior
* A summary of verbal discussions, or the text of email discussions with community moderators, administrators, registration, or other event organizers about the proposed consequences and behavioral modification plan
* A summary of verbal discussions, or the text of email discussions with the reported person
* The text that was sent to follow up with the reporter
* All discussion summaries should include dates that they took place.

### Ongoing Documentation of Event and Community Bans {#ongoing-documentation-of-event-and-community-bans}

The BIDS-maintainers shall maintain a list of people who have been banned from BIDS-organized events including:

* The effective date of their ban
* The duration of their bans, or whether the ban is permanent.

This list shall only be viewable by the maintainers.

### Privacy Concerns {#privacy-concerns}

There are some common privacy pitfalls to online tools like Google Docs. Make sure to always share the document with committee members who don't have a conflict of interest, rather than turning link sharing on. This prevents people outside of the committee from accessing the documents.

Another common issue is that when a folder is shared with the whole committee, even if a person doesn't have edit or view access to an individual report, they can still see the document's title. This can give information away, such as the person who made the report. Some communities use initials in the report title instead. That can still reveal information, and it makes it hard to talk about report status in public spaces (such as an event). The committee may want to assign a code name to each report, and reference that name in the report title and status spreadsheet. You can use an online random phrase generator to create the code name.

When on-boarding a new Code of Conduct committee member, they should be provided with a list of names of people who have been reported in active Code of Conduct incidents. The new committee member should state whether they have any conflicts of interest with reviewing documentation for those cases. If not, they will be given edit access to the report documents.
